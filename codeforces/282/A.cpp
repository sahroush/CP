//When we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change.
//If I try, I fail. If I don't try, I'm NEVER GOING TO GET IT.
//Sometimes, life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel. But if you just keep moving... you will come to a better place.
//It is important to draw wisdom from diffrent places. If you take it from only one place it becomes rigid and stale.
